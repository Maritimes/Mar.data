# Mar.data

Nov 13, 2020 - Mike McMahon (mike.mcmahon@dfo-mpo.gc.ca)

This is a data-only repo supporting functions from Mike McMahon's packages, i
including Mar.utils, Mar.datawrangling and Mar.bycatch.
These datasets were originally embedded in the Mar.utils package, but they made 
the package too large - it was unwieldy to update, and my understanding is that
these data files are rarely used.
