# Mar.data

June 24, 2019 - Mike McMahon (mike.mcmahon@dfo-mpo.gc.ca)

This is a data-only repo supporting functions from Mar.utils and Mar.datawrangling.
These datasets were originally embedded in the Mar.utils package, but they made 
the package too large - it was unwieldy to update, and my understanding is that
these data files are rarely used.
